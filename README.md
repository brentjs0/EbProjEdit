# EB Project Editor
*GUI CoilSnake Project Editor*

## Summary

EB Project Editor is a graphical Java application used to edit projects created with [CoilSnake](https://pk-hack.github.io/CoilSnake/), the most powerful mod making tool for the game EarthBound. It is distributed as part of CoilSnake, but it can also be used independently.

## Installation

1. Download and install [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) if you don't have it already.
2. Get CoilSnake from the [official website](https://pk-hack.github.io/CoilSnake/). Once you have it, EB Project Editor can be opened by starting CoilSnake and selecting "EB Project Editor" under the "Tools" menu.
3. If that version of EB Project Editor doesn't work for you, download and run [EbProjEdit.jar](https://github.com/brentjs0/EbProjEdit/raw/master/EbProjEdit.jar) from this repository.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble using the application, you can ask for help on the [Starmen.net PK Hack forum](https://forum.starmen.net/forum/Community/PKHack/). If you find a bug or have an update to suggest, feel free to [report a new issue](https://github.com/brentjs0/EbProjEdit/issues).
